    <h2>What is Badminton?</h2>
    - Badminton is a racquet sport played using racquets to hit a shuttlecock across a net. Although it may be played<br>
     with larger teams, the most common forms of the game are "singles" and "doubles"
     <ol>
        <li><h3>How to play SINGLES BADMINTON?</h3></li>
        - As per badminton singles rules, the server starts from the right service court, and will serve from that side<br>
         every time they have an even amount of points. A player serves from the left every time they have an odd amount<br>
         of points. Each player will retain serve for as long as they keep winning points.
         <li><h3>How to play DOUBLE BADMINTON?</h3></li>
         - In badminton doubles, the server will start on the right-hand side and keep serving, while alternating sides<br>
          with their team-mate, so long as they keep winning points. If the receiving side takes the point, they assume serve.
